# Advent of Code #

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly programming challenge. Every day during the month of December, a new programming problem is released, totalling 25 unique problems.

This repository is a collection of my solutions to these problems, and will be updated accordingly as time goes on.

I first attempted the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in 2020, and made it to day 22. That year was originally a separate github repository, but I've pulled it into this one for ease of access. 2020 solely used Visual Studio to manage the challenges, while 2021 and forward will use CMake.

Out of both curiosity and boredom, I'm also going through previous years and coming up with solutions to those challenges as well. I'll be going through them backwards by year, so updates to them may appear from time to time.
