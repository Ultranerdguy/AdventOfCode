## Advent of Code ##

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly programming challenge. Every day during the month of December, a new programming problem is released, totalling 25 unique problems.

This repository is a collection of my solutions to these problems, and will be updated accordingly as time goes on.

I first attempted the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in 2020, and made it to day 22. That year was originally a separate github repository, but I've pulled it into this one for ease of access. 2020 solely used Visual Studio to manage the challenges, while 2021 and forward will use CMake.
