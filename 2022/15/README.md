> You feel the ground rumble again as the distress signal leads you to a large network of subterranean tunnels. You don't have time to search them all, but you don't need to: your pack contains a set of deployable sensors that you imagine were originally built to locate lost Elves.
> 
> The sensors aren't very powerful, but that's okay; your handheld device indicates that you're close enough to the source of the distress signal to use them. You pull the emergency sensor system out of your pack, hit the big button on top, and the sensors zoom off down the tunnels.
> 
> Once a sensor finds a spot it thinks will give it a good reading, it attaches itself to a hard surface and begins monitoring for the nearest signal source beacon. Sensors and beacons always exist at integer coordinates. Each sensor knows its own position and can determine the position of a beacon precisely; however, sensors can only lock on to the one beacon closest to the sensor as measured by the Manhattan distance. (There is never a tie where two beacons are the same distance to a sensor.)
> 
> It doesn't take long for the sensors to report back their positions and closest beacons (your puzzle input). For example:
> ```
> Sensor at x=2, y=18: closest beacon is at x=-2, y=15
> Sensor at x=9, y=16: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
> Sensor at x=13, y=2: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
> Sensor at x=12, y=14: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
> Sensor at x=10, y=20: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
> Sensor at x=14, y=17: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
> Sensor at x=8, y=7: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
> Sensor at x=2, y=0: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
> Sensor at x=0, y=11: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
> Sensor at x=20, y=14: closest beacon is at x=25, y=17
> Sensor at x=17, y=20: closest beacon is at x=21, y=22
> Sensor at x=16, y=7: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
> Sensor at x=14, y=3: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
> Sensor at x=20, y=1: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
> ```
> So, consider the sensor at 2,18; the closest beacon to it is at -2,15. For the sensor at 9,16, the closest beacon to it is at 10,16.
> 
> Drawing sensors as S and beacons as B, the above arrangement of sensors and beacons looks like this:
> ```

> This isn't necessarily a comprehensive map of all beacons in the area, though. Because each sensor only identifies its closest beacon, if a sensor detects a beacon, you know there are no other beacons that close or closer to that sensor. There could still be beacons that just happen to not be the closest beacon to any sensor. Consider the sensor at 8,7:

## Part 1 ##

As part of this puzzle, we have a series of sensors and beacons, with which we can map out the dead-zones in our area, and we're tasked with finding the total number of guaranteed non-beacon spots on a single row.

From the example data, it looks like we could just construct a 2D grid, and label each point as either beacon or not, but a brief glance at the puzzle data shows that such a grid would be far too large to process efficiently. However, there's not a lot of sensors in the input data, so we could probably iterate through all the sensors, and (for a given point) check if each one is in range (range being determined by the distance from sensor to its nearest beacon).

This is still a little wasteful, since we need to iterate through a large x-axis range to count all the non-beacon spaces. An alternative approach puts the iteration on the sensors rather than the x-axis.

For a given fixed y-value and for each sensor, determine if the sensor intersects the line (abs(sensor.y-yvalue) <= radius), then determine where its intersection starts and ends. Combine overlapping starts and ends into a single section, and once none of them overlap anymore, add up their areas. Finally, subtract the number of beacons with that y-value.

This reduces the compute time from depending on the size of the grid, to depending on the number of sensors.

## Part 2 ##

Now we actually need to find the beacon. With such a large search area, simply repeating the process in part 1 for every y value from 0 to 4,000,000 would be wasteful (though worth a try).

In the end, I did brute force through the 4,000,000 lines. The previous optimisations I made were useful in keeping runtime low, but after looking at the advent of code subreddit, it seems I missed a trick.

Instead of iterating through all the rows of the grid, we can instead walk just outside each sensor's area. If the point we're on is inside the clip range, check if it's inside any other sensors. If it's outside all other sensors, then it's our point of interest.

My current approach takes approximately O(R\*S) time to compute (R = range size (4,000,001), S = sensor count (23)), while the walking approach takes about O(S\*(S-1)\*r) time (r = average radius). Since S is much smaller than R, and the average radius is most likely much smaller than R too (otherwise a single sensor could fill the whole area), this could result in a significant speed up. I'll need to remember this for another time.
